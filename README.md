The pint° (/pĩntʊ/) programming language.

> [!WARNING]
> The pint° programming language is still in very early development stage, and
is not recommended for use in production software. Use at your own risk.

The pint° programming language is a language that compiles to Dart.

It has the following objectives:

- Have seamless interoperability with Dart;
- Consider Flutter as first-class;
- Generate reasonably readable and efficient Dart code;
- Be terser and more expressive than Dart;
- Provide a powerful macro system with great ergonomy.

```haskell
import @async

let name = "pint°"
let isTheBestLanguage = true

type Complex(T) = Complex(
  [⊤] listOfAny,
  [T] listOfT,
  {T} set,
  {T: T} map,
  T? maybeT,
  Future(T) futureOfT,
  int aSimpleInt,
  {{T?} : [Future(T)]} aMonster
)

let main _ =
  print "Hello, world!"  

```

You can get started with the language by reading
[the documentation](https://mateusfccp.me/pinto/docs).
